- Transaction and activity logging by the admin
- Virtual keyboards for OTPs
- Strict access control for all users
- Self-signed certificate for HTTPS (MITM prevention)
- Firewall and port blocking
- CSRF protection via tokens
- XSS prevention by properly cleaning & escaping all user inputs
  

## Vulnerabilities Discovered

Following are the vulnerabilities discovered by our peers in the testing phase:
